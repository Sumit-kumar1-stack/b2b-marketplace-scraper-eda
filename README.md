## B2B Marketplace Data Collection & Analysis

### Overview
This project implements a robust data collection pipeline for B2B marketplaces such as Alibaba, followed by exploratory data analysis.

### Part A – Data Collection
- Targeted categories: Industrial Machinery, Electrical Equipment
- Implemented a modular scraper
- Added blocking detection and fallback mechanism
- Output format: CSV

### Note on Scraping Limitations
Alibaba employs dynamic rendering and anti-bot mechanisms. When scraping is blocked, the system automatically generates a structured fallback dataset to ensure pipeline continuity.

### Part B – Exploratory Data Analysis
- Supplier distribution analysis
- Product frequency trends
- Location-based insights
- Visualizations saved to output/eda

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
